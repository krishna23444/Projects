Objective :
- Read a wavefile using ascii-to-binary conversion
- Process the speech signal into frames (short-segment) 
- Use appropriate windowing function on the short-segment
- Use simple time domain features to detect begin and end of the speech signal
- Use simple time domain features to denoted voiced and unvoiced region in the speech signal 
- Extract the spectral features using FFT (standard routines in Matlab)
- Resynthesize the signal back using IFFT (you would need both magnitude and phase information)
- Resynthesize the signal using unit mangnitude and original phase
- Resynthesize the signal using original magnitude and unit phase 
- Perform linear prediction analysis on voiced and unvoiced segments and report your observation
- Use appropriate filters to derive the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients 



ZC: 190 and above indicate UNVOICED regions.
 
LPC: -3.2741 to -0.4602 indicate VOICED regions
       0.1449 to  -2.8705 indicate UNVOICED regions
 
ENERGY: 0.005 and above indicate VOICED regions
 
If the energy level and zero-crossing rate of 3 successive frames is high it is a starting point.
After the starting point if the energy and zero-crossing rate for 5 successive frames are low it is the end point.
